# Redux quiz group project

In this project we created an awareness quiz using Redux and React. The aim of the quiz is to memorise the image or video and then answer a question.

This project was made as a group project by Linnea Isebrink, Rebecca Blixt, Fatima Gamero Romero, Lena Simma, Reinis Kalvins & Naushin Malik. 

## The problem

This was our first time working with Redux and the majority of the teammates were confused and found it difficult to grasp the concept. Through teamwork and the generosity of the teammates that understood the basics enough to figure out how to use Redux, we were able to complete the project. We also had some issues with the styling due to an overambitious plan with the limited time we had for the project. This was solved by changing our design.
If we had more time we would have focused on the styling.
